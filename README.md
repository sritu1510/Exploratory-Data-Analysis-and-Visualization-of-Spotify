## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Exploratory Data Analysis is a process of examining or understanding the data and extracting insights or main characteristics of the data. EDA is generally classified into two methods, i.e. graphical analysis and non-graphical analysis. EDA is very essential because it is a good practice to first understand the problem statement and the various relationships between the data features before getting your hands dirty.
